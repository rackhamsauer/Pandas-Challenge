# Pandas-Challenge

•	Summarizes the analysis (5 points)
o	This was a challenging and interesting analysis. There were so many ways that the data could be sliced, and even more that we did not do in this exercise. Being able to reference the tables so many different ways was both confusing and awesome. I used all of our previous lessons to complete this as well as using chat gpt and stack overflow, and ask the class on slack, to help me solve the many bugs I encountered. I appreciated the starter code very much, it helped outline what I was trying to do.
•	Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
o	1. At its highest level, Charter schools perform better in academics than District schools.
o	2. Larger schools perform worse than medium and small schools in academics.
o	3. Even considering size all schools had a similar per student budget, but higher spending did not correlate to better academic scores.
o	4. There was not a grade that better performed on average in reading or math.
