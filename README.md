School Performance Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of school performance data, specifically comparing Charter schools and District schools. The goal of this project was to analyze academic performance metrics in relation to various factors such as school size, spending per student, and performance in different subjects.

Overview
The analysis was both challenging and interesting, with numerous ways to slice the data and generate insights. Referencing the tables in different ways made the task complex but rewarding. I utilized previous lessons, along with additional resources such as ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, and Slack through class collaboration, to help solve several bugs and challenges encountered along the way.

The starter code provided was extremely helpful in outlining the approach, and it allowed me to focus on solving the core analysis tasks.

Analysis Summary
This project explored several key aspects of school performance and generated multiple conclusions based on the calculations. Below are the conclusions drawn from the analysis:

1. Charter schools perform better academically than District schools.
On average, Charter schools had higher academic performance in comparison to District schools.
2. Larger schools perform worse than medium and small schools in academics.
The data showed that larger schools had lower academic performance than smaller or medium-sized schools, suggesting that school size may impact academic outcomes.
3. Higher spending does not correlate to better academic performance.
Although all schools had similar per-student budgets, higher spending did not appear to result in better academic scores, indicating that other factors might contribute more to academic success.
4. No particular grade level performed better in reading or math.
The analysis revealed that there was no grade level that consistently outperformed others in reading or math, indicating similar academic outcomes across all grade levels.

Tools and Resources Used
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
